# metascraper

A library to easily scrape metadata from an article on the web using Open Graph metadata, regular HTML metadata, and series of fallbacks. Following a few principles:

- Be usable on the server and in the browser.
- Make it simple to add new rules or override existing ones.
- Don't restrict rules to CSS selectors or text accessors.

## Example

Using Metascraper, this metadata...

    {
      "author": "Ellen Huet",
      "date": "2016-05-24T18:00:03.894Z",
      "description": "The HR startups go to war.",
      "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ioh_yWEn8gHo/v1/-1x-1.jpg",
      "publisher": "Bloomberg.com",
      "title": "As Zenefits Stumbles, Gusto Goes Head-On by Selling Insurance"
    }

...would be scraped from this article...

## Server-side Usage

On the server, you're typically going to only have a `url` to scrape, or already have the `html` downloaded. Here's what a simple use case might look like:

```js
import Metascraper from 'metascraper'

Metascraper
  .scrapeUrl('http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/as-zenefits-stumbles-gusto-goes-head-on-by-selling-insurance')
  .then((metadata) => {
    console.log(metadata)  
  })

// {
//   "author": "Ellen Huet",
//   "date": "2016-05-24T18:00:03.894Z",
//   "description": "The HR startups go to war.",
//   "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ioh_yWEn8gHo/v1/-1x-1.jpg",
//   "publisher": "Bloomberg.com",
//   "title": "As Zenefits Stumbles, Gusto Goes Head-On by Selling Insurance"
// }
```

Or, if you are using `async/await`, you can simply do:

```js
const metadata = await Metascraper.scrapeUrl('http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/as-zenefits-stumbles-gusto-goes-head-on-by-selling-insurance')
```


Similarly, if you already have the `html` downloaded, you can use the `scrapeHtml` method instead:

```js
const metadata = await Metascraper.scrapeHtml(html)
```

That's it! If you want to customize what exactly gets scraped, check out the documention on [the rules system](#rules).


## Browser-side Usage

In the browser, for example inside of a Chrome extension, you might already have access to the `window` of the document you'd like to scrape. You can simply use the `scrapeWindow` method to get the metadata:

```js
import Metascraper from 'metascraper'

Metascraper
  .scrapeWindow(window)
  .then((metadata) => {
    console.log(metadata)  
  })

// {
//   "author": "Ellen Huet",
//   "date": "2016-05-24T18:00:03.894Z",
//   "description": "The HR startups go to war.",
//   "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ioh_yWEn8gHo/v1/-1x-1.jpg",
//   "publisher": "Bloomberg.com",
//   "title": "As Zenefits Stumbles, Gusto Goes Head-On by Selling Insurance"
// }
```

Or if you are using `async/await` it might look even simpler:

```js
const metadata = await Metascraper.scrapeWindow(window)
```

Of course, you can also still scrape directly from `html` or a `url` if you choose to.


## Creating & Overiding Rules

By default, Metascraper ships with a set of rules that are tuned to parse out information from online articlesâ€”blogs, newspapers, press releases, etc. But you don't have to use the default rules. If you have a different use case, supplying your own rules is easy to do.

Each rule is simply a function that receives a [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) instance of the document, and that returns the value it has scraped. (Or a `Promise` in the case of asynchronous scraping.) Like so:

```js
function myTitleRule($) {
  const text = $('h1').text()
  return text
}
```

All of the rules are then packaged up into a single dictionary, which has the same shape as the metadata that will be scraped. Like so:

```js
const MY_RULES = {
  title: myTitleRule,
  summary: mySummaryRule,
  ...
}
```

And then you can pass that rules dictionary into any of the scraping functions as the second argument, like so:

```js
const metadata = Metascraper.scrapeHtml(html, MY_RULES)
```

Not only that, but instead of being just a function, rules can be passed as an array of fallbacks, in case the earlier functions in the array don't return results. Like so:

```js
const MY_RULES = {
  title: [
    myPreferredTitleRule,
    myFallbackTitleRule,
    mySuperLastResortTitleRule,
  ]
}
```

The beauty of the system is that it means simple scraping needs can be defined inline easily, like so:

```js
const rules = {
  title: $ => $('title').text(),
  date: $ => $('time[pubdate]').attr('datetime'),
  excerpt: $ => $('p').first().text(),
}

const metadata = Metascraper.scrapeHtml(html, rules)
```

But in more complex cases, the set of rules can be packaged separately, and even shared with others, for example:

```js
import Metascraper from 'metascraper'
import RECIPE_RULES from 'metascraper-recipes'

const metadata = Metascraper.scrapeHtml(html, RECIPE_RULES)
```

And if you want to use the default rules, but with a few tweaks of your own, it's as simple as extending the object:

```js
import Metascraper from 'metascraper'

const NEW_RULES = {
  ...Metascraper.RULES,
  summary: mySummaryRule,
  title: [
    myPreferredTitleRule,
    myFallbackTitleRule,
    mySuperLastResortTitleRule,
  ]
}

const metadata = Metascraper.scrapeHtml(html, NEW_RULES)
```

For a more complex example of how rules work, [check out the default rules](/lib/rules).
