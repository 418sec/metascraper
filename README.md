## Getting Started

**metascraper** is library to easily scrape metadata from an article on the web using Open Graph metadata, regular HTML metadata, and series of fallbacks. 

It follows a few principles:

- Have a high accuracy for online articles by default.
- Be usable on the server and in the browser.
- Make it simple to add new rules or override existing ones.
- Don't restrict rules to CSS selectors or text accessors. 

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install metascraper --save
```

## Usage

Let's extract accurate information from the following article:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/add-comparison/support/screenshot.png)](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/as-zenefits-stumbles-gusto-goes-head-on-by-selling-insurance)

```js
const metascraper = require('metascraper')
const got = require('got')

const targetUrl = 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/as-zenefits-stumbles-gusto-goes-head-on-by-selling-insurance'

;(async () => {
  const {body: html, url} = await got(targetUrl)
  const metadata = await metascraper({html, url})
  console.log(metadata)
})()
```

Where the output will be something like:

```json
{
  "author": "Ellen Huet",
  "date": "2016-05-24T18:00:03.894Z",
  "description": "The HR startups go to war.",
  "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ioh_yWEn8gHo/v1/-1x-1.jpg",
  "publisher": "Bloomberg.com",
  "title": "As Zenefits Stumbles, Gusto Goes Head-On by Selling Insurance",
  "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/as-zenefits-stumbles-gusto-goes-head-on-by-selling-insurance"
}
```

## Metadata

Here is a list of the metadata that **metascraper** collects by default:

- **`author`** — eg. `Noah Kulwin`<br/>
  A human-readable representation of the author's name.

- **`date`** — eg. `2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z`<br/>
  An [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) representation of the date the article was published.

- **`description`** — eg. `Venture capitalists are raising money at the fastest rate...`<br/>
  The publisher's chosen description of the article.

- **`image`** — eg. `https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20160504155601-GettyImages-174457162.jpeg`<br/>
  An image URL that best represents the article.
 
- **`logo`** — eg. `https://entrepreneur.com/favicon180x180.png`<br/>
  An image URL that best represents the publisher brand.

- **`publisher`** — eg. `Fast Company`<br/>
  A human-readable representation of the publisher's name.

- **`title`** — eg. `Meet Wall Street's New A.I. Sheriffs`<br/>
  The publisher's chosen title of the article.

- **`url`** — eg. `http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-wins-trial-against-oracle-saves-9-billion`<br/>
  The URL of the article.
  
## How it works

?> Configuration file follow the same approach than projects like Babel or Prettier.

**metascraper** is built out of rules.

It was designed to be easy to adapt. You can compose your own transformation pipeline using existing rules or write your own. 

Rules are a collection of HTML selectors around a determinate property. When you load the library, implicitly it is loading [core rules](#core-rules).

Each set of rules load a set of selectors in order to get a determinate value. 

These rules are sorted with priority: The first rule that resolve the value successfully, stop the rest of rules for get the property. Rules are sorted intentionally from specific to more generic.

Rules work as fallback between them:

- If the first rule fails, then it fallback in the second rule.
- If the second rule fails, time to third rule.
- etc

**metascraper** do that until finish all the rule or find the first rule that resolves the value.

## Customization

If you want to load more rules set that the provided by default, you need to define a configuration file via:

- A `.metascraperrc` file, written in YAML or JSON, with optional extensions: `.yaml/.yml/.json/.js`.
- A `prettier.config.js` file that exports an object.
- A `"metascraper"` key in your `package.json` file.

The configuration file will be resolved starting from the location of the file being formatted, and searching up the file tree until a config file is (or isn't) found.

The order of rules are loaded are important: Just the first rule that resolve the value will be applied.

### Basic Configuration

Declared an `array` of `rules`, specifying each rule as `string` name of the module to load.

#### JSON

```json
// .metascraperrc
{
  "rules": [
    "metascraper-author",
    "metascraper-date",
    "metascraper-description",
    "metascraper-image",
    "metascraper-logo",
    "metascraper-publisher",
    "metascraper-title",
    "metascraper-url"
  ]
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml
#  .metascraperrc
rules:
  - metascraper-author
  - metascraper-date
  - metascraper-description
  - metascraper-image
  - metascraper-logo
  - metascraper-publisher
  - metascraper-title
  - metascraper-url
```

### Advanced Configuration

Additionally, you can pass specific configuration per module using a `object` declaration:

#### JSON

```json
// .metascraperrc
{
  "rules": [
    "metascraper-author",
    "metascraper-date",
    "metascraper-description",
    "metascraper-image",
    "metascraper-logo",
    {"metascraper-clearbit-logo": {
    "format": "jpg"
    }},
    "metascraper-publisher",
    "metascraper-title",
    "metascraper-url"
  ]
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml
# .metascraperrc
rules:
  - metascraper-author
  - metascraper-date
  - metascraper-description
  - metascraper-image
  - metascraper-logo
  - metascraper-clearbit-logo:
      format: jpg
  - metascraper-publisher
  - metascraper-title
  - metascraper-url
```

### Write your own rules

A rule set is the simplest way for extending **metascraper** functionality.

A rule set can add one or more properties support. 

The following schema represents the API compromise that a rule set need to follow:

```js
'use strict'

// `opts` can be loaded using `.metascraperrc` config file
module.exports = opts => {
  // You can define as props as you want.
  // props are organized based on an object key.
  return ({
    logo: [
      // You can setup more than one rules per prop (priority is important!).
      // They receive as parameter:
      // - `htmlDom`: the cheerio HTML instance.
      // - `url`: The input URL used for extact the content.
      // - `meta`: The current state of the information detected.
      ({ htmlDom: $, meta, url: baseUrl }) => wrap($ => $('meta[property="og:logo"]').attr('content')),
      ({ htmlDom: $, meta, url: baseUrl }) => wrap($ => $('meta[itemprop="logo"]').attr('content'))
    ]
  })
}
```

We recommend check [core rules packages](/packages) as examples.

## API

### metascraper(options)

#### options

##### html

*Required*<br>
Type: `String`

The HTML markup for extracting the content.

#### url

*Required*<br>
Type: `String`

The URL associated with the HTML markup.

It is used for resolve relative links that can be present in the HTML markup.

it can be used as fallback field for different rules as well.

## Comparison

To give you an idea of how accurate **metascraper** is, here is a comparison of similar libraries:

| Library | [`metascraper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metascraper) | [`html-metadata`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-metadata) | [`node-metainspector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-metainspector) | [`open-graph-scraper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-graph-scraper) | [`unfluff`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unfluff) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Correct | **95.54%** | **74.56%** | **61.16%** | **66.52%** | **70.90%** |
| Incorrect | 1.79% | 1.79% | 0.89% | 6.70% | 10.27% |
| Missed | 2.68% | 23.67% | 37.95% | 26.34% | 8.95% |

A big part of the reason for **metascraper**'s higher accuracy is that it relies on a series of fallbacks for each piece of metadata, instead of just looking for the most commonly-used, spec-compliant pieces of metadata, like Open Graph.

**metascraper**'s default settings are targetted specifically at parsing online articles, which is why it's able to be more highly-tuned than the other libraries for that purpose.
